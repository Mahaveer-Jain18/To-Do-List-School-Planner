## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows an object-oriented design with the following main components:

### Core Classes

#### Task Class (`task.py`)

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title, description, due_date, priority):
        self.id = unique_id
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
        self.due_date = due_date
        self.priority = priority  # LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
        self.status = "TODO"  # TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
```

#### TaskManager Class (`task_manager.py`)

Manages all task operations:
- `add_task()`: Create new tasks
- `get_all_tasks()`: Retrieve all tasks
- `get_task_by_id()`: Find specific task
- `update_task()`: Modify task details
- `delete_task()`: Remove tasks
- `filter_by_status()`: Filter tasks by status
- `filter_by_priority()`: Filter tasks by priority
- `search_tasks()`: Search functionality

#### UserInterface Class (`ui.py`)

Handles all user interactions and display formatting.

### Data Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`) for persistence between sessions.
